This repo provides a basic Django application used to create questions with choices and vote for a choice (polls app). 

The process of listing questions, displaying choices, and showing poll results is automatically tested with various test case scenarios using Pytest.

The test cases can be found under "tests.py" under "polls" directory.

Commented code inside the file is test cases created with Django's own testing framework. It's left in the file for reference.
